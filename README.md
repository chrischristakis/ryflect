# Front end
- [x] Figma layout
- [x] Basic layout pages (No styling)
- [x] Add a 'loaded' property for journalIDs, since checking if empty isn't reliable
        - New users have empty journalIDs, so website woudln't work for them if we check using isEmpty
        - THIS IS CAUSING RERENDERS OF THE ENTIRE PAGE! WE NEED TO CHECK IF SOMETHING IS LOADED FIRST
            - No need for context, just a loaded property that waits for all api calls on a page to complete before rendering content.
- [x] Snoop around for rerenders to fix
- [x] Cookies
    - Test what happens when user goes to other user's journal after being logged in, should bring them to unauthorized page
- [x] Add user bar in navbar, support logout, change password, FAQ
- [x] Fix registration and login forms to use custom hooks
    - Both handle errored fields the same way, try to streamline this so code is less bulky.
- [x] Make sure if one cookie is missing, we force use to login again and reset cookies by logging them out
- [x] Get markdown working
    - Should be on the fly, display what the markdown would look like as the user types
- [x] save a html journal entry and a plaintext entry with no tags.
- [x] Handle errors on each page
    - For example, on verify email, decide what to do if verfication has expired. What do we display?
- [x] If user plaintext cuts off an escaped character (since plaintext is escaped) we need to handle it appropriately.
- [x] Do not let user go to create journal page if journal already exists, grey out button.
- [x] Proper loading (Animation?)
- [x] Dummy FAQ, Change password pages
- [x] Button loading gif while waiting for a response
- [x] Put in Michelle's gif (Ty Michelle)
- [x] More basic styling...
- [x] Test deploy + feedback
